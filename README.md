I used Windows 11 OS for setup. What I need to do is to follow the guide and complete following toolchains download and installment
  
Part1: Installing Toolchain
1.Get a exe ending with -arm-none-eabi.exe. 
Note: tick the Add to Path choice during the installment so that use complier directly.

2.Cmake installment: Also, remember to choose add to path during your installment.

3.Installing build tools in Visual Studio 2022, following components are necessary under desktop C++ development:
-Windows 10 SDK
-MSVC 143
-Testing tools for core features
-C++ Address sanitizer
-C++ make tools for CMake
4. Python 3.10 install
During the installation, ensure that itâ€™s installed 'for all users' and add Python 3.10 to the system PATH when prompted by the installer. You should additionally disable the MAX_PATH length limit when prompted at the end of the Python installation

5. Installing Git:
Note!!!: Remember to tick the checkbox to allow Git to be used from 3rd-party software and, unless you have a strong reason otherwise, when installing Git you should also check the box "Checkout as is, commit as-is", select "Use Windows' default console window", and "Enable experimental support for pseudo consoles" during the installation process.

Part2: SDK Environment Setup
1.Enter these command on the terminal to fetch pico-sdk and pico examples files from Github Repository: 
C:\Users\pico\Downloads> git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git 
C:\Users\pico\Downloads> cd pico-sdk C:\Users\pico\Downloads\pico-sdk> git submodule update --init 
C:\Users\pico\Downloads\pico-sdk> cd .. 
C:\Users\pico\Downloads> git clone-b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git

2.Use Visual Studio Developer command to open the VScode: then it is time for setting environment for SDK and build hello.c by CMake tools. 
Firstly, you need to enter a code in the terminal to open VScode. Then you should install necessary extensions in VS market space: Cmake tools, before modifying its settings. 
-scroll down to "Cmake: Configure Environment". Click on "Add Item" and set the PICO_SDK_PATH to be ..\..\pico-sd
-scroll down to "Cmake: Generator" and enter "NMake Makefiles" into the box.
3.Finally, its time for building the hello world target: Click Files at left top and choose open folders to open the pico-examples folder, and choose the complier as GCC for arm-none-eabi12.2. Then you can click the build button at bottom to generate uf2 files. Drag uf2 to your board, then you can find the hello world is output on your terminal!
